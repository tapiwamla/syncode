## Run Locally
This project is not currently live on any server. But to use the demo version, follow the steps below:
- Clone this repository and cd into it
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- To start the react app client run `yarn start` in one terminal
- To start the server run `yarn server:dev` in another terminal
- Go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app
- To join as an another user open another browser or incognito tab and go to `http://localhost:3000`
- Enter the same room id to join the same room

Now both your editor will be synced and you can see the changes in real time. Try opening the same room in multiple tabs and see the changes.
